To get noticed, you need a _hook_. There are so many engineers out there gunning
for the same position you are, so it is imperative you stand out. You are marketing
yourself during this process.

## Find you Narrative

This is going to be a theme throughout your entire search.  People want to know what
you are all about, and where you are coming from.

To help find that, ask yourself these questions.

+ _Where am I coming from?_
+ _What am I looking for in my next job?_
+ _Why do I want to be a software engineer?_
+ _Where do I want to be in the next couple years?_

This will serve as your personal elevator pitch. Use your best judgement about what
to include and when to say it.

## Build an Online Presence

Like any product, you need a presence online. This all starts with a domain.

If you do not already have a personal domain, go out and buy one. **Do not** be a
cheapskate, get a good top level domain. `.com`, `.io`, & `.me` are some good
ones.

### Constructing a Website

Now you have a domain, start making a website. It's ok if you are not a web developer,
it does not have to be fancy.

There are three main requirement of your personal page.

+ Serve as a landing page
+ Serve as a resume
+ Support blog posts

#### Some Good Choices

I personally reccomend [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) as a static website generator.
It allows great templating, plenty of pre-fab themes exist out there, and Github
Pages [supports](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/)
it out of the box.

You could also with a CMS such as [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) if you want a
live site, it also is fairly friendly to less HTML inclined folks.

#### Fill it up with Content

You should use your site as a quick summary and put some blog posts in there. If you
are looking for ideas of stuff to write about, write about what you are doing.

Just in this section you bought a domain and set up a site. You can use those.

Do not worry about your blog posts being perfect, you'll get better the more you do it.

### Set Up Email with Your Domain

An easy way to immediately stand out in an inbox is to have your own email address.
Since you now have a domain, use that. This is such an easy freebie that can go along
way in making you look more professional.

There are plenty of services out there that will integrate with your domain, without
requiring you to set up your own email server. I use
[GSuite](https://gsuite.google.com/), but there are plenty of alternatives.

### Clean up/Set up your Github profile

A Github/Gitlab profile is essential in your search. Engineers will always visit these
profiles when scoping you out. This will serve as your landing page for all your
personal projects. Be sure to also add a link back on your profile to your personal
site.

## Clean up those Social Profiles

The internet **never** forgets what you did, and you most likely have a bunch of
different social services you are a part of.

### Facebook

If you have a Facebook, start there with your cleanup. Mutual friends should be the
farthest group removed that can see most of your stuff.

+ Clean up images
+ Untag yourself from those drunk photos
+ Remove those late night rants

### Twitter

Twitter can actually be a huge help in building a brand, but it can also crush you.

If you are an active Twitter user, double check that you do not have any sketchy
stuff there either.

If you are an experienced tweeter, use that to your advantage.  Start talking more
about stuff that relates to the field you want to get into.

### LinkedIn

If you do not have one of these yet, get one.

Go through this and build out your profile, update everything.  This should mirror
your resume, (something we will go over more in a later post). Make sure you have
professional profile picture, link to your personal page, put any personal projects
in there.

For the job history portion, use your best judgement, it should mirror your resume
and use strong actionable language. If you do not have a lot of job history, you
will have to include some of your more embarassing jobs.

## Extra Credit

Up your SEO game, add linkbacks to your personal site on every platform and project
you are tied to. You could even add
[Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/) to your site.
