So you have a [brand](/First-Job-Branding), some super dope finished
[projects](/First-Job-Personal-Projects) with some more cool ones in the pipeline,
and some great [resumes](/First-Job-Resume), start applying!

This is where you go balls to the wall with every resource you have. If you have any connections,
it's time to use them. Also check out all the hiring sites.  There is a bunch of great ones out
there to use, so use all of them.

## Choosing Jobs to Apply To

**Do not apply to every job**. You will only be wasting everyone's time. Read through the job
description and requirements, if you like the sound of the company, reach out.

## Some warning signs

There are postings and descriptions that should send out red flags.

**Excessive X years with X thing requirements**.  This is a sign that the company does
not understand what a software engineer is. A good engineer can adapt and is always
searching out new things.

Yes, there is a threshold where people using a specific language will start to know good
paradigms, idiomatic patterns, and most of the standard library. It's ok for companies to
ask for things like that, but there should never be a hard year requirement.

**Poorly written postings**. This is a no brainer. If someone couldn't be bothered to write a good
post, they aren't worth your time.

**Low pay offset by high equity**. This is usually a sign of a early startup. Except most
ground-level startups usually hire through networking. People that are lurking on job boards for
cheap engineers with the promise of good pay to come, usually don't have a good business plan or
are not doing well with their recruitment. Later in your career feel free to take chances on early
startups, but for a first job it's not a good idea.

**Long upfront code challenge**. Sometimes companies require you do a coding challenge before
applying. If they require this as prerequisite and it comes across as something that will take
more than an hour, don't waste your time.

If they don't respect your time now, they won't respect it while you work there.
