Personal projects will take you a long way in your coding journey.  In my opinion,
all software engineers should always have at least one personal project they are
working on.

When searching for your first job, no one will believe you are up to the challenge
if you do not have tangible things to point to as your own. So start building out
that Github.

_Pro-tip:_ This is something you can be working on side by side with your job
searching. It's easy to get completely consumed by your project, don't let that
happen. You will have plenty of time to build super dope shit after you are
employed.

## Project Ideas

If you are stuck, on coming up with ideas, here are a couple good starting points.

+ [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org) has some nice ideas for web development
+ [Awesome Project Ideas](https://github.com/karan/Projects)
+ [Public Data Sets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)

Personally, since I was entering the web space, I set up a bunch of sites, worked
with different frameworks, built a couple apis, and did all the hosting.

You can leverage existing data sources out there too. Twitter has a great [api](https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en.html).
If you are in a city, go to some Code Jams.

## Project Size

Keep your projects light and small. If you have spent more than 20 hours on a single
project, you've spent too much time. Save bigger projects for when you have more
time.

## Don't Abandon Your Projects

No one is interested in your project if it does not work.

Half broken projects are not very interesting either.

## Engineering Teams Want to See Code

An engineering team will often spend most of their time looking through your personal
code. Most teams I have been a part of, basically just glance at the resume and spend
the rest of the time going through a canidate's Github.

Engineers want to see that you can start and complete stuff.

I cannot overstate how key this is in getting engineers to pay attention to you.
However, this work will do nothing to get you passed HR.
