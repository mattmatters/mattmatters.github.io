This part is how you get passed HR.

A resume is never for the engineers, it's for HR. Try to always keep that in mind
when writing it. Here's some key guidelines.

## Non technical people read this

HR does not know or understand what setting up load balancing for a Kubernetes
cluster means. Putting stuff like that down does absolutely nothing to impress
them, they are getting 20 more people like you saying stuff they don't understand.

Try to keep everything as actionable items that the common person can understand.
Let's rewrite a bit.

Take this example: _Set up a auto-scaling GKE cluster with strong redundancy and
failover mechanisms_

Let's change it to: _Designed a scalable cluster that achieved 99% uptime_

We took techno jargon and turned it into something a regular person can understand.
Better yet we phrased it as a huge accomplishment. This leads into the next part.

### Experience should be phrased as accomplishments

Companies are looking for people that can **get there stuff done**. People usually
instead get caught up with putting as many tech names and buzzwords in there. Don't
do that.

#### Example

Think of it this way, you are a house builder. A potential client asks you _"What
is your experience building houses?"_. You are not going to respond _"Well I can
use a hammer, saw, metric and imperial socket sets, duct tape, nails, and screws."_

The client already assumes you know how to use those things, your title is _House
Builder_ after all. You are instead going to tell him about the ranch and victorian
homes you built and maybe some of the challenges you overcame while doing it.

The same applies to the tech industry. Potential employers are looking for people
that have accomplished and built things. Your resume is a chance to do that.

## Building the resume

Ok now that you have some general guidelines in place, here a quick resume
bootstrapper.

Unless you are going for a graphic oriented position, go with a template. Make sure
you choose something that you can heavily customize and supports many different
versions. I personally went with [this](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV).

Be prepared to answer questions about every part of your resume. Engineers usually
base most of their questions off the resume they looked at right before coming in
to meet you.

### Job History

This is a chance to show how you are such a hard worker. Since most jobs leading up to
this probably are not very tech oriented, you can keep some of it fairly light for now.

Put experience in there with every bullet point being an actionable item. **Do not lie
about your experience**, but also feel free to flourish a bit with it.

Warehouse work for example: _Coordinated shipping and receiving logistics_.

If you feel that your former employer would laugh or question what you put down, don't
use it.

### Personal Projects

Those personal projects I [talked about](/First-Job-Personal-Projects)? Put them in here.
This is how you comphensate for the lack of formal experience or education you have. Try
to emphasize the parts that apply to the job you are applying to.

## Tailor your Cover Letter and Resume to each company

This might sound like a lot of work, _well it is_. Your cover letter should have a bit of
boilerplate fluff, the rest should be this.

+ Why are you are interested in the company?
+ Why are you a great fit?

The resume should also emphasize portions of your skillset that are applicable to the
posting.

The most amount of your time in the job search will be spent writing cover letters, but it
really helps with getting passed HR.

## HR is a barrier for you to cross

HR's main purpose in the hiring process is to filter out the riff raff.  They see a lot of shit
resumes every day. Have you ever used Tinder? Because that can quickly be how they look through
applications. If you don't immediately stand out in some manor, you are out. Luckily most
hiring software now sends you rejection letters. _Hurray?_

_Is it fair?_ **No**

A protip is to always politely ask if there is anything you can improve upon if you get a
rejection notice.  I've gotten some very helpful tips, like _"You could actually ask for money
next time around"_ or _"Hey Californians get offended a lot easier than New Englanders"_.
