Getting the first job is one of the most difficult parts of a new developers life.

I came from a background without any education or connections, which put me several
tiers below a lot of my peers when job searching.

**Reader beware:** Starting out without a degree will require an extreme amount of
effort, you will need to work extra hard.

## Inspiration

I was inspired to write this series after getting my second software job. I ended up
going through the first job process twice. The first was like everyone starting out,
the second was after moving to the other end of the country and not having any of my
connections to rely on.

The process is long and ardous, and I would be honored if this helped anyone looking
to start out.

## Directory

I have divided this into multiple parts. This will be updated as I add new parts.
