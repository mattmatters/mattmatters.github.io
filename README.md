# The Matters of Matt

My personal site built on Jekyll.

The styling and theme credits go to [Victorvoid](https://github.com/victorvoid) for his incredible
[Space Jekyll template](https://github.com/victorvoid/space-jekyll-template).

Feel free to fork this or do whatever you'd like.

## Building and Serving

To build for production run this.
```shell
$ jekyll build
```

Otherwise you can run a dev server that autobuilds on file change like this.
```shell
$ jekyll serve
```
