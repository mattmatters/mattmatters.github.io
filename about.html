<h2> Backend / "Fullstack" Web Developer </h2>

<p>Making stuff is cool, but solving problems is even cooler.</p>

<p>
    I focus on building scalable web applications.  Solving problems such as to never
    keep a system from going down, error handling, and all the other complications
    from production applications.
</p>

<p>
    Even better though is making something impactful, providing actual utility to the
    end user. Solving programming problems is fun, but solving real world problems
    through programming is awesome.

    I'd love to connect if you feel the same way.

<h4>The Matters of Matt</h4>
<p><b>Freelance Web Designer:</b> <i>Jan. 2015 - presentish</i></p>
<p>
    Custom websites for people.  I initially started just making websites with custom
    styling and layouts and hosting them on AWS for people.
</p>
<p>
    Turns out the part I enjoyed the most was the systems side of things.  Making
    something pretty is rewarding, but it's not the type of problems I get the most
    enjoyment out of solving.
</p>
<p>
    I still do some website design on occassion but at this point it's mostly for
    friends who just need a little help establishing a web presence.
