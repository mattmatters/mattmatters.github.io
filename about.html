    <h2> Backend / "Fullstack" Web Developer </h2>
    <p>Making stuff is cool, but solving problems is even cooler.</p>
    <p>
        I focus on building scalable web applications.  Solving problems such as to never
        keep a system from going down, error handling, and all the other complications
        from production applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even better though is making something impactful, providing actual utility to the
        end user. Solving programming problems is fun, but solving real world problems
        through programming is awesome.

        I'd love to connect if you feel the same way.
